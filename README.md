# Data Analyst Portfolio 
## This portfolio showcases my work on a variety of guided projects, including:

- Predictive Modeling: Leveraging machine learning algorithms to forecast outcomes and trends.
- Data Wrangling: Cleaning, transforming, and managing large datasets using tools like Python (Pandas, NumPy) and SQL.
- Data Visualization: Crafting intuitive and informative dashboards using Power BI, Tableau, and Matplotlib.
- Cloud Integration: Working with AWS to build scalable data pipelines and storage solutions.

Feel free to explore the projects, and let's connect if you'd like to collaborate or discuss any opportunities!
